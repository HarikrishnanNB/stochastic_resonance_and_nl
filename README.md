# ChaosFEX

Feature Extraction using Chaos

This repository contains optimized Python modules for transforming feature matrices
into higher dimensions using estimates derived from chaotic skew-tent maps.

[Video explanation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JQstLi4COk) on the usage of chaotic maps as kernels and highlighting chief ideas and inspiration.
